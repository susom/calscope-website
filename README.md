# CALSCOPE Covid-19 Study Website

This site will be hosted on GCP in an App Engine Instance.

Potential study participants will first come to the site to accept their study invitation.

Once they complete the intake survey, they will then wait for test kits to be mailed to them.

On receipt they will come back to the website to "activate" their kits and initiate the participant survey.
