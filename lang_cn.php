  ,"faqs_desc" => "Frequently Asked Questions"
  ,"faqs_1_q" => "What is the CalScope study?"
  ,"faqs_1_a" => "CalScope is a study run by the California Department of Public Health to learn more about how many people in California may have been infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 (called SARS-CoV-2 or coronavirus). Californians who join this study will answer an online survey and take a finger-prick blood test to see if they may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 before. The test for this study looks for antibodies in the blood, which show that a person has been infected with a virus before. By looking for antibodies, we can measure the prevalence, or the number of people who have antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19. This will help us understand how many people in California may have been infected with COVID-19 up to this point. The California Department of Public Health is working with local county health departments and Stanford University for this study."
  
  ,"faqs_2_q" => "Why is this study important?"
  ,"faqs_2_a" => "The goal of this study is to learn more about how many people in California may have been infected with COVID-19 up to this point, even if they never felt sick. This information will help us learn more about how the virus that causes COVID-19 has spread in California. Information collected from this study will also help the California Department of Public Health and local public health departments as we work to prevent and stop the spread of this virus."
  
  ,"faqs_3_q" => "Who can be part of this study?"
  ,"faqs_3_a" => "The California Department of Public Health will randomly mail letters to households asking them to take part in this study. This invitation letter will have a special registration code that people can use if they want to join the study. Up to 2 people (1 adult and 1 child older than 6 months) from each household can participate. If there are multiple adults and children living in your household, we ask that the adult and child with the nearest upcoming birthday join this study. Only households that receive a mailed invitation letter can join. If you get an invitation letter, do not share the letter with people in a different household, even if you do not want to join the study."
  
  ,"faqs_4_q" => "If I join this study, what will I be asked to do?"
  ,"faqs_4_a" => "If you want to join the study, you’ll be asked to complete a one-time survey online that will ask for basic information about you and your household, as well as your activities and medical history. You will also be asked to use a test kit at home to collect a finger-prick blood sample."
  
  ,"faqs_5_q" => "How long will the survey and blood test take?"
  ,"faqs_5_a" => "The online survey will take about 20 minutes to complete for each person. The finger prick test will take about 5-10 minutes. After you complete and send in your survey and blood test, you will get your test results back in about 3-4 weeks."
  
  ,"faqs_6_q" => "If I receive an invitation letter in the mail, how can I register to be part of the study?"
  ,"faqs_6_a" => "<p>If you get an invitation letter for this study, it will have a special registration code that you can use to register for the study online. Here are the steps for registering and taking part in the study:</p>
                  <ol>

  ,"faqs_7_q" => "If I don’t have access to a computer with Internet connection, what other ways can I be part of this study?"
  ,"faqs_7_a" => "Access to the Internet is preferred to be able to take part in this study, but you don’t have to have a computer to participate. If you have a smartphone or a mobile phone with a data plan that allows you to access the Internet, then you can still take part in this study. The survey and other forms for this study may be completed on your phone’s Internet browser or through an app. If you don’t have access to the Internet, you can contact us to participate by phone. You can contact the CalScope study team by phone at xxx-xxx-xxxx or email at calscope@cdph.ca.gov to get help with the website, app, or any other part of the study."
  
  ,"faqs_8_q" => "What other languages are the materials for this study available in?"
  ,"faqs_8_a" => "All materials for the CalScope study will be available in English, Spanish, Chinese (Traditional), and Tagalog."
  
  ,"faqs_9_q" => "If I receive an invitation letter, do I have to join the study?"
  ,"faqs_9_a" => "<p>No, you do not have to join the study if you don’t want to. If no adult from your household wants to join the study, but a child is willing, the child may join the study if they have permission from a parent or legal guardian to join. An adult must also be willing to help the child register and take part in the study. Children must be at least 6 months old to take part in the study. Anyone that decides to join the study can choose to skip any survey questions they do not want to answer. You may also withdraw from or drop out of the study at any time.</p>
                  <p>If no one in the household wants to complete either the survey and/or the blood test kit, you should throw away the invitation letter. The invitation letter is only for the household address that it is mailed to, so please do not give the invitation letter to other people who live at a different address.</p>"
  
  ,"faqs_10_q" => "Do I have to complete both the survey and blood test kit to be part of the study?"
  ,"faqs_10_a" => "We hope that people who join the study will be able to complete both the survey and the blood test kit, but we understand that it may not be possible for everyone. You can choose to only complete the online survey and not complete the blood test kit."
  
  ,"faqs_11_q" => "What is this study testing for? How is this test different from other COVID-19 tests?"
  ,"faqs_11_a" => "<p>This study is designed to learn more about how many people in California may have been infected with or have developed antibodies to the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19. Antibodies are proteins in the blood that are a made by a person’s immune system when they are infected with a virus. If a person has antibodies in their blood, it is a sign that they have been infected with a virus before, even if they didn’t have symptoms. People may develop antibodies 1-3 weeks after being infected with a virus. An antibody blood test won’t be able to tell if you currently have COVID-19 or not.</p>
                  <p>This test is different from other COVID-19 tests, which usually involve a nose or throat swab. These swab tests are used to see if someone is currently sick or infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.</p>"
  
  ,"faqs_12_q" => "Does it cost money to take part in the study?"
  ,"faqs_12_a" => "No, it does not cost money to take part in the study. The testing offered in this study is free."
  
  ,"faqs_13_q" => "Is my participation in this study confidential?"
  ,"faqs_13_a" => "<p>Yes, your participation in this study is confidential. The survey will not ask for your personal information, such as your name or birthday. All survey and blood test results are collected anonymously (meaning we don’t ask for your name) in order to protect your identity. All information collected from this study is tracked only using the registration and test kit codes that you enter online.</p>
                  <p>In order to provide you with study updates, we will ask you to provide your phone number and email, but you don’t have to share this information if you don’t want to. As soon as your participation is completed or if you withdraw from the study, any contact information that you shared with us will be erased.</p>"
  
  ,"faqs_14_q" => "How is my information protected?"
  ,"faqs_14_a" => "<p>Any information that you share with us is stored on a secure server and is password protected. Only the research team can use this data, and none of the data contain personal information that can identify you. All of the researchers that are part of this study must receive training and certifications to make sure that they know how to properly handle data and protect the privacy of all participants. We will not collect personal information like your name or birthday that could be used to identify you. Also, any contact information, such as phone numbers, email, and home addresses, will be kept separate from survey and test data.</p>
                  <p>Information from this study will only be used by the CalScope study team. Any survey responses or test results will not be shared with other groups that are not involved in the study. Information from everyone that joined the study will be grouped together and analyzed for reports used by the California Department of Public Health. Any information from this project will be analyzed and reported as a group, meaning there is no way that someone will be able to find or see your specific survey or test results. Since all survey responses and test results are collected anonymously (without names), they cannot and will not be reported to the state’s electronic disease reporting database or shared with any other governmental program.</p>"
  
  ,"faqs_15_q" => "Will I receive my blood test results? When?"
  ,"faqs_15_a" => "Yes, if you submit a finger-prick blood sample using the home test kit, you will receive your test results, which will tell you if you have coronavirus antibodies or not. After you send in your test kit by mail, you should receive your results by mail within 3-4 weeks. If both an adult and child from your household sent in test kits, you can find your results by both the age and code listed on the test kit. We do not collect your name or other personal information, so the test kit code is the best way to know which test results are yours. If you do not get your test results within 4 weeks after returning the kit, you can contact the CalScope study team by phone at xxx-xxx-xxx or email at CalScope@cdph.ca.gov."
  
  ,"faqs_16_q" => "If my test result is positive (results show “antibodies present”), what does that mean?"
  ,"faqs_16_a" => "A positive antibody test, or a result that says, “antibodies are present,” means that you may have been infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) in the past. A positive antibody test does not mean that you are currently infected or sick with COVID-19.  It can take 1-3 weeks or longer for a person’s immune system to develop antibodies after being infected with a virus.
It’s important to know that a positive antibody test may be wrong, and that you may have never been infected with the virus before. This kind of error (called a “false positive”) is uncommon, and only happens about 5 to 15 times out of 100 tests. This is the first time these antibody tests have been used for testing at home, so we can’t be 100% sure of the exact accuracy of these tests yet.
The antibody test used in this study is meant to be used for public health purposes only. The results of this test should not be used to make medical decisions. Scientists do not know if having antibodies to the COVID-19 virus protects you from getting infected again in the future. The test used in this study has been designed and tested for research but has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). You should not change your behavior based on your result of the antibody test. You should continue to follow public health recommendations to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
For more information about COVID-19 tests that are used to look for past infection, please visit the CDC COVID-19 Test for Past Infection website."
  
  ,"faqs_17_q" => "If my test result is negative (results show “antibodies absent”), what does that mean?"
  ,"faqs_17_a" => "A negative antibody test, or a result that says “antibodies are absent”, means the test did not find antibodies in your blood, meaning you may never have been infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) in the past. However, because it can take 1-3 weeks or longer for a person’s immune system to develop antibodies after being infected with a virus, this test can’t tell whether you are currently infected with the virus.
It’s important to know that a negative antibody test may be wrong, and that you may actually have been infected with the virus before. For example, the test may not have been able to detect any of the antibodies that you have in your blood. The test may also have been taken too early or too late after infection. This kind of error (called a “false negative”) is uncommon, and only happens about 1 time out of 100 tests. This is the first time these antibody tests have been used for testing at home, so we can’t be 100% sure about the exact accuracy of these tests yet.
The antibody test used in this study is meant to be used for public health purposes only. The results of this test should not be used to make medical decisions. Scientists do not know if having antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 protects you from getting infected again in the future. The test used in this study has been designed and tested for research but has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

  ,"faqs_18_q" => "What are the possible benefits of taking part in this study?"
  ,"faqs_18_a" => "You should not expect any direct benefit from taking part in this study. The information collected in this study is used to help the California Department of Public Health and local health departments as we work to prevent and stop the spread of COVID-19."
  
  ,"faqs_19_q" => "What are the possible risks of taking part in this study?"
  ,"faqs_19_a" => "The antibody test uses a finger prick to collect a blood sample, so you may have pain or bruising in the area where you pricked your finger after you complete the blood test. Rarely, a finger prick can cause an infection. Before you prick your finger for the blood test, you will be asked to wash your hands with soap and water and use the alcohol wipes included in the test kit to make sure the skin on your finger is clean. This will help prevent infection after the finger prick. Information in the test kit will also help you find the right size finger-prick needle to use to help prevent pain or discomfort during the finger prick."
  
  ,"faqs_20_q" => "Will I receive any payment for taking part in the study?"
  ,"faqs_20_a" => "Yes. To thank you for joining in the study, you will receive a $20 gift card for each online survey that is completed for your household. You will also receive a $20 gift card after the CalScope team receives each completed test kit from your household. Your household will receive a total of $80 if both 1 adult and 1 child completes all surveys and test kits for this study. Gift cards will be sent by email or text within 1-2 business days, although physical gift cards may take about 1-2 weeks for participants to receive by mail."
  
  ,"faqs_21_q" => "What is COVID-19?"
  ,"faqs_21_a" => "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, which is also called coronavirus. COVID-19 spreads to people though droplets or small particles that leave an infected person’s body when they cough, sneeze, sing, talk, or breathe. COVID-19 causes many different symptoms. Some people who have COVID-19 may not feel sick at all. Others may have a flu-like illness with fever, cough, diarrhea, and even loss of smell. Some people may get very sick and have severe disease involving the lungs and other parts of the body. People with severe COVID-19 may need to stay in the hospital."

  ,"faqs_22_q" => "What is SARS-CoV-2?"
  ,"faqs_22_a" => "SARS-CoV-2 is the name of the virus that causes COVID-19. Like all viruses, SARS-CoV-2 is made up of genetic material--in this case, RNA--surrounded by a type of shell or coating. These viruses can enter human cells and make people sick."
  
  ,"faqs_23_q" => "What are antibodies?"
  ,"faqs_23_a" => "Antibodies are proteins made by a person’s immune system that attach to a virus that enters the body. Antibodies help the body’s immune system find and kill a virus that enters the body. A person’s immune system makes new antibodies any time they are infected with a new virus or germ. It takes time for the body to make antibodies. A few weeks may go by before there are enough antibodies in a person’s blood for a blood test to be able to find them. Antibodies can stay in the blood for a long time, even after an infection is gone or if a person is no longer sick. If the antibody to the SARS-CoV-2 virus is found in the blood, that means that the person was once infected with the virus before, even if they didn’t feel sick. But because antibodies can stay in the blood for a long time, an antibody test doesn’t tell us exactly when the infection happened."
  
  ,"faqs_24_q" => "How can someone tell if they are infected with SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 right now?"
  ,"faqs_24_a" => "The most common way to know if a person is infected with coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) or has COVID-19 is to swab the nose or throat and test to see if the virus is there. A laboratory uses a test called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to look for genetic material of the virus in the sample collected from a person. A PCR test is very good at finding a virus in a sample and can find infection in 92 to 100 out of 100 tests. Finding the virus in a swab test means you may have been infected recently (within a few weeks)."
  
  ,"faqs_25_q" => "Can people get infected with the coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) more than once?"
  ,"faqs_25_a" => "Yes. There have been a few cases reported of people who have been infected with the coronavirus more than once, but we believe this is very rare."
